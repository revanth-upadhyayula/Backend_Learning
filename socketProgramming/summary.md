# Key Concepts
To establish a tcp connection between `client` and `server` there are so many way to do:


    ->In node there is an internal module known as `net`, which helps to get the tcp connection between the `client` and `server`.

    ->There is also another internal module known as `http`, which helps us to make http connection between `client` and `server`.
We don't have to do all these as the frameworks like `Express` does all the things to use.But it internally uses these module to set up the connection.
